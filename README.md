# Movie-Correlation-Project
Movie revenue is one important measure of good and bad movies. It also offers important and intuitionistic feedback to producers, directors and actors. Therefore, it is worthy to put effort on analyzing what factors affect revenue, so that movie makers know how to get higher revenue on next movie by focusing on most correlated factors. Our project analyzes different kinds of factors, for example, genres, movie elements, popularity, release month, runtime, vote average, vote count on website and cast etc.

## Data & Methods

We basically use python on Jupyter notebook to do the analysis, including data cleaning and visualization.Dataset is obtained fron Kaggle.

## Conclusion
It appears that the relationship between a movie’s budget and its revenue is quite strong—it has a Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.74 in this data.
