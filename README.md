## Correlation
Correlation is a statistical measure that describes the relationship between two or more variables. It quantifies the strength and direction of the relationship between variables, and it ranges between -1 and 1.

● A correlation coefficient of +1 indicates a perfect positive correlation, meaning that as one variable increases, the other variable also increases, and vice versa.\
● A correlation coefficient of -1 indicates a perfect negative correlation, meaning that as one variable increases, the other variable decreases, and vice versa.\
● A correlation coefficient of 0 indicates no correlation, meaning that there is no relationship between the variables.\
● A correlation coefficient between 0 and 1 (0 < r < 1) indicates a positive correlation, meaning that as one variable increases, the other variable also increases, but the relationship is not perfect.\
● A correlation coefficient between 0 and -1 (0 > r > -1) indicates a negative correlation, meaning that as one variable increases, the other variable decreases, but the relationship is not perfect.

Correlation can be measured using a number of methods such as the Pearson correlation coefficient, the Spearman rank correlation coefficient, and the Kendall's rank correlation coefficient.

## Movie-Correlation
Movie revenue is one important measure of good and bad movies. It also offers important and intuitionistic feedback to producers, directors and actors. Therefore, it is worthy to put effort on analyzing what factors affect revenue, so that movie makers know how to get higher revenue on next movie by focusing on most correlated factors. Our project analyzes different kinds of factors, for example, genres, movie elements, popularity, release month, runtime, vote average, vote count on website and cast etc.

## Data & Methods

We basically use python on Jupyter notebook to do the analysis, including data cleaning and visualization. Dataset is obtained fron Kaggle.

## Conclusion
It appears that the relationship between a movie’s budget and its revenue is quite strong—it has a Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.74 in this data.
